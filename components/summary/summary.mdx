## I am...

I'm a passionate developer with more than 10 years experience in backend and frontend technologies.
I'm product minded and have pretty good analytical skills. Over the last years I acquired some
acquaintance with best practices, testing, q&a, architecture,... got even obsessed with them.
With time I really like to adapt and create balance, I know more and more the conditions for
a successful project and I like to keep in mind that there's no magic recipes. I also do mentoring for
juniors, write open-source experiments on spare time and really like to help as project advisor.

## My current tech skills...

In this rapidly changing world, let's simply say that I'm working mainly with React / Typescript and its
associated ecosystem (redux, jest, webpack, babel...) for the **frontend**.
I first developed components to be embedded in traditional websites around 3 years ago,
then going the SPA (react-router, PWA's...) road. Nowadays I feel quite comfortable with it
and I must say I love it. The React/typescript combination is amazing !

On the backend side, I worked mainly with PHP even if I'm playing a lot with Node/Express which is quite
fun to do. I've been through the major frameworks like Zend or Symfony, concepts like MVC, DI, IoC, ORM... have
been integrated long time ago. I got really interested by application architecture (SOLID, DDD...), it definitely
brings effective solutions when the app grows. But sincerely more I learn, less I feel knowing.
At least I got few things on the way ;)
Nowadays and following the API centric trend, I mostly develop with micro-frameworks, like zend-expressive and
PSR specs. I'm also expert in SQL and relationship databases.

## What I'm looking for ?...

Ideally a front-end developer role within a human-sized team in Brussels area.
React & Typescript would be the perfect match, but I'm still open to mix it
with backend work (node, php). I'm also to open to short term missions (1m+). It all depends on the task.
