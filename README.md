# profile-in-a-rush

**profile/in/a/rush** is a personal self-challenge hackaton to finally write a C.V. 

> Written in **Typescript** with **NextJs**/**React** and styled through 
> **emotion.sh** *(which I've never used before)*...  
>
> I'm not really looking to improve it, though I would be happy to see someone take
> it over, make something configurable and share a more *polished* project. 
> 
> But please don't use my texts, my profile picture or the links to my accounts. 
> In other words clean up a bit ;) 

### Why opensource ?

First of all it's more an experiment. Also I like opensourc.
  
### What is interesting to look for ?

See the [skills components folder](./components/skills) it was really fun to write. 
It uses framer motion for animations. Spend almost a day to get what I wanted ;)

For a more traditional React example see the [github folder](./components/github), a react hooks api call
with some over-engineering.

Interested in Typescript example, see [error.ts](./components/core/result.ts).

Interested in configuring this website, see the [config folder](./config) 

### Wants to see the result ?

Go there: **[https://me.soluble.io](https://me.soluble.io)**. No tracking, no cookies.

### Some parts are hacky... 
 
... don't you fear it can have a negative effect ?

I'm fine with that  ;)  


### Why linked.in for contact ?

Yes I'm not so happy with this...  not fan of it.
